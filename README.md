js-slideEngine
==============
Simple, HTML-based presentations - with JavaScript
--------------------------------------------------

The target user is a web developer presenting in front of an audience at a conference, meet-up, meeting, etc.

The goals for js-slideengine are (most important first):
* Work in Gecko/FireFox
* PageUp/PageDown slide navigation
* Allow in-slide editing and execution of JavaScript
* Resolution independence
* HTML simplicity
* Look good
* Work in WebKit/Safari/Chrome
* JavaScript simplicity
* CSS simplicity
* Work in IE

Instructions for Use
--------------------

1. Copy or rename template.html
2. Edit the HTML file, giving each slide the "slide" class.
3. Optionally edit user.js and user.css.

Use textareas for your JavaScript code. To avoid strange browser behavior on page reload, give each textarea a unique name.
